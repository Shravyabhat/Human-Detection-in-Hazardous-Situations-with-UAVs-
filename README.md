# Human-Detection-in-Hazardous-Situations-with-UAVs-
Developed a robust, real-time human detection system for UAVs for rescue operations in challenging environments, such as natural calamities. Used multi-model solution leveraging YOLOv8 for accurate human detection. Advanced Pre-Processing done in order for enhanced image qulaity for better detection. Dehazing and de-blurring techniques also used to enhance detection accuracy in smoky or hazy conditions. Applied a CNN-based model to upscale low-resolution images, improving detection of small human figures captured from high altitudes by UAVs.
